# CrypDist
Data sharing is crucial for genomics research as it facilitates discovery of recurrent mutations that may contribute to human disease. However, as noted by the Cancer Gene Trust Network and the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health, shared data must be safe from being removed from databases by financial or political reasons. Here we introduce, CrypDist, a fully decentralized system based on the blockchain technology that enables synchronized data sharing among researchers with protection against data removal. It also provides version tracking for future updates to the data, avoids third-party access using cryptographic data structures, and it maintains URL links to large amounts of additional data sets, which are not feasible to distribute, to be kept within an existing content delivery network.
